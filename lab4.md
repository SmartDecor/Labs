##### (Introduction)
* "... a data system to organize, document, manipulate and compile water, 
soil, management, and economic data for assessment of conservation practices."
*  "... the technical and operation requirements that meet the needs 
of the Conservation Effects Assessment Project Watershed Assessment Studies and some additional information."
* USDA hydrology science humans
* "The USDA and Agricultural Research Service (ARS) have supported hydrologic research since the 
1930's and many of the research watersheds are still operational. However, data have been 
managed and made available independently at each research location, greatly reducing the 
accessibility and utility of these data for policy-relevant, multi-site analyses."
* It follows the structure closely. The titles of some of the sections are different but they have the same meaning.

##### (Use cases)
* "A central database management system for the uploading, 
storage, and management of data, and a client application to allow users access and interact with the 
data."
* No case diagram
* Actors: system operator, data operations manager, watershed uploaders, ARS users, research users & public users.
* There's a paragraph of text for each of them, describing their roles, desires and the functionality they require.

##### (General structure of the system)
* There are a lot of charts for example, Flow-chart, Entity-relation diagram etc.

##### (Functional & non-functional requirements)
* Functional requirements in section 3.1.3
* Non-functional requirements in section 5.
* Yes for functional and non-funtional requirements.
